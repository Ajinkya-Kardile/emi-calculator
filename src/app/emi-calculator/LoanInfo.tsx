                <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                    An <strong>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)</strong> is a fixed monthly payment
                    that a borrower makes to a lender while repaying a loan.
                    It includes two main components: <strong>principal</strong> (the original loan
                    amount) and <strong>interest</strong> (the cost of borrowing).

                    or any other loan,
                    the EMI remains constant throughout the tenure. The amount depends on factors like the <strong
                    className="font-bold">loan amount, interest rate, and tenure</strong>.
                </p>

                    budget is not affected by unexpected expenses.

                    Several key factors influence the <strong

                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700  dark:text-gray-300 space-y-2">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Loan Amount (Principal)</strong> – The higher the <strong>loan amount</strong>,
                        the higher the EMI.
                        A <strong>Loan EMI Calculator</strong> helps you estimate the monthly

                    <li>
                        <strong>Interest Rate</strong> – Higher <strong>interest rates</strong> lead
                        to increased EMI payments.
                        The rate depends on the loan type (e.g., <strong>Home Loan, Personal Loan, or Car Loan</strong>)
                        and the lender&#39;s terms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Loan Tenure</strong> – A <strong>longer tenure</strong> reduces the
                        EMI amount but increases the total interest paid over time.
                        Shorter tenures result in higher EMIs but lower overall interest costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Type of Interest</strong> – Loans can have <strong>fixed or floating interest rates</strong>.
                        Fixed rates keep the EMI constant, while floating rates fluctuate based on market conditions.

                        <strong>Prepayments & Part-Payments</strong> – Making <strong
